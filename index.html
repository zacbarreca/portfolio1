		<h2>About Me</h2>
 		<p>
           Hi, my name is Zac.
           <br><br>
           My background is in the entertainment industry. In fact, until very recently
           I was a poker dealer. I decided to pursue software engineering because
           I wanted to take on work that was more meaningful to me. I found out about
           coding bootcamps through the Career Karma community and their podcast
           called Breaking Into Tech.
           <br><br>
           Iâ€™m passionate about software engineering because it gives me the opportunity
           to realize my creative potential, build things people love, and collaborate
           with a team of talented coworkers.
           <br><br>
           When I'm not coding I can be found spending time with my family or taking care of
           my rescue pitbull, Petey. I also enjoy volunteering and helping out with poverty
           relief and health initiatives in my community.
